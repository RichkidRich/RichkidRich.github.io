					<h3 class="colorlib-heading">Hardware Arcade Design Project written in Verilog</h3>
					<h4 class="color-1">Project Description</h4>
					<p>This arcade machine comprises of two parts. The first is the game itself, which was programmed completely with a hardware description language called Verilog and built onto an FPGA. The second is the gaming peripheral, which was made out of a plastic tupperware box and some large buttons. The game is based on a popular Japanese arcade game called "Bishi Bashi"</p>
					<h4 class="color-1">Tools and Skills</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Verilog</li>
						<li>Quartus Prime</li>
						<li>ModelSim</li>
						<li>Altera DE1-SoC FPGA</li>
					</ul>
					<h4 class="color-1">Detailed Overview</h4>
					<p>As part of a digital hardware course, I had to form a team of two and conjure a design for a project which utilised Verilog. My partner and I decided to make an arcade game. We then designed the games (two games) from scratch followed by planning out the code and the design of the game peripheral we would be building and connecting. Both our games were inspired from Bishi Bashi. Bishi Bashi is an arcade machine that only has four buttons, which are used to play and navigate fast minigames. Our games were called "Bread Dead Redemption" and "Tower Fall"</p>

					<h5>Bread Dead Redemption</h5>
					<p>This is a game where bread falls from the top of the screen (sky) into a toaster. The goal of the game is to save the bread from becoming toast. There are three columns of bread falling from the sky, each column corresponding to one of the three buttons on the controller (excluding the fourth menu navigation button). Pressing the button before the bread reaches the toaster would save the bread, gaining one point. The player keeps going until they lose.</p>

					<h5>Tower Game</h5>
					<p>This game features a tower that is made up of colored blocks. Each floor of the tower comprises of 1 block and each block has a color corresponding to one of the three buttons on the controller (excluding the fourth menu navigation button). Pressing the button that corresponds to the color of the block at the bottom of the tower would remove that block, causing the tower to fall one block, giving the player a point. The player has 30 seconds to clear as many floors of the tower as possible. The faster the player mashes buttons, the higher their score.
					</p>

					<h5>The Controller</h5>
					<p>We knew the controller would be built by hand with materials sourced from whatever shops were nearby. The frame of the controller was a tupperware box. We bought some large arcade buttons from a nearby hardware store and cut holes into the tupperware box that fit the buttons. The buttons were connected to the FPGAs GPIO pins through a small breadboard we placed inside the box.

					<h5>Project Structure</h5>
					<p>My teammate and I were good friends so we knew each others strengths and weaknesses very well. We decided to split the workload and tasks evenly amongst each other, however one person would be mainly responsible for the game code and the other would be responsible for the gaming peripherals and the code related to that. This workload designation worked as the most important portions of our project were managed better since the progresss of each one was kept under watch by at least one of us.</p>
