					<h4 class="color-1">Project Description</h4>
					<p>As the CEO of a student run business called Maché, we created a sold notebooks with detachable whiteboards inside them. The covers of the notebooks were made with recycled newspaper and half the profits were donated to a local charity. </p>

					<h4 class="color-1">Detailed Overview</h4>
					<h5>The Team</h5>
					<p>Maché had 5 departments: Human Resources, Finance, Marketing, IT and Production. Each department had around 5 people and 1 department director. The department directors would work closely with the CEO to help plan and make informed decisions about what to do next. Since we were a student run business, we also had a mentor from industry that would give us guidance and advice.</p>

					<h5>Our Idea</h5>
					<p>Our goal at Maché was to create something a notebook that let you make temporary annotations whilst still being environmentally friendly. Thus, we designed a notebook with a detachable clear whiteboard which could be reattached on any page, allowing you to use a whiteboard marker to annotate everything on the page. The cover of the notebook would be made of newspaper. Each notebook was made by hand and features a different newspaper mosaic design. </p>

					<h5>Building the Product</h5>
					<p>After coming up with an idea, we had to build up enough capital to invest in the resources necessary to not only create the notebooks in question but also create the popup booths where we would be selling these books. We built out initial capital by selling shares to people.
					</p>

					<p>After collecting our initial capital, we bought all our materials and crafted each book by hand. Since the students in the business were not receiving any salary, our team basically comprised of volunteers. We made a shift schedule and all took turns creating all 500 whiteboard notebooks in our stock.</p>

					<h5>Selling our Product</h5>

					<p>Upon creating all our stock, we set out to sell it at various popup sites around school as well as at a large public convention in Hong Kong. While part of the company was building the stock, the marketing department focused on making our promotion campaign and booth design. This helped a lot in getting customers and we ended up selling out all our stock before the convention ended.</p>

					<h5>The Result</h5>
					<p>The fruits of our labor were a massive success and Maché turned a roughly 150% profit. We held a shareholder meeting to report our progress and success. During this meeting with the shareholders, we voted to donate half of the profits to a local charity for the elderly, UniHeart.</p>
